# Chess
A Python-based Chess GUI and Engine developed as a final project for CS40S. This project allows users to play a friend, play a bot, or visualize a battle between bots. It's built using the pygame library in python.

## Todo Engine
- Add Pawn moves to Move Tables
- Test using named tuples for storing moves
- Test using ENums
- Better pattern to checkmate (force king to edge)
- Only run in_check if not capturing on piece (change order)
- Use move tables for pin and check getting
- Store less info in move (store move_type with ep, double, prom_type, etc. all in one field)

## Todo GUI
- Add buttons (back, quit, sound, home)
- Add menu
- Add different gamemodes (play a friend, play engine, visualize battle)
